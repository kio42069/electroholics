  Using discord API, webhooks and ESP32 devkits, we can interface chat commands with real life

## Concept

People can send commands to a Bot, and an ESP will react to the same and do some kind of action like flicker the lights, announce a message via a speaker. 

Ooh yes a message announcer will be really helpful. Can also add in a function to make it such that there will be multiple nodes, and users can choose a specific node to send a message to, so that all nodes are not disturbed. Additionally, can add in deep sleep at the Node ends, so that only the nodes where people are nearby will stay on and will be notified.
